iOS POC that takes pictures provided and returns them back ordered in
biggest smiles in each photo.

## Getting started
Facam is a Cordova and Ionic app. You need to have
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed first. Then install Cordova and
Ionic with:
  npm install -g cordova ionic

## Starting the app
You can build the app using Ionic's tools. Start off with running `ionic platform add ios`. Then to build the app, use `ionic build ios`. You should have a built app now. To run in in the simulator, use `ionic emulate ios`. Since it uses the camera, you'll want to run it on an actual device, which requires xcode.
